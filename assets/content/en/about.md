## Our history

Our non-profit was founded in May 2017. Its first goal was our participation in the [First Global Challenge 2017](https://first.global/archive/fgc-2017/) in Washington D.C.

### First contest

After three months spent building, training and communicating, we finally met the 156 attending countries. Unfortunately, bad alliances and poor robot efficiency led us to a disappointing ranking. Nevertheless, our well documented blog made us come back with the silver medal of the Sofia Kovalevskaya award.

### 2017-2018 season

</div>

We participated in two competitions :
- The [trophées de robotique](http://tropheesderobotique.fr)
  - First the regional contest. We ranked second and thus were qualified for the national level.
  - Then the national contest, during two days in Saint-Quentin. We ended 20th out of 62 teams.
- The 18th World Adolescent Robot Contest in the FGC category.

This contest took place in Guyiang, China. Thirty teams were attending : 15 chinese teams and 15 international ones.

We won two awards:
  - The international unity award for the help we provided to other teams and our involvement in communication.
  - The winning alliance award because we won this championship.

### 2018-2019 season

Our non-profit evolves. We have new team members to participate in contest and, moreover, we begin an education component by animating a weekly robotic worshop for children in the [social center Condorcet](https://www.espacecondorcet.org/).

This season, we plan to participate in the [trophées de robotique](http://tropheesderobotique.fr) once again and [Astro-Pi](https://www.astro-pi.org).

### 2019-2020 season

Of course a very disturbed season. Our weekly robotic worshop for children in the [social center Condorcet](https://www.espacecondorcet.org/) went on until lockdown. We also manage to run two [micro-bits](https://archive.microbit.org/) workshops in the library. About the robotics contest, after being involved in the [trophées](http://tropheesderobotique.fr) then in the [coupe de France](https://www.coupederobotique.fr/) they were both cancelled/re-scheduled.

### Season 2020-2021

Just before the second lockdown, we were able to participate for the first time in the [French Robotics Cup](https://www.coupederobotique.fr/). The experience alongside Matthieu and Mohamed was extremely interesting. Otherwise, the season unfolded with mixed results: another year without a physical competition, but we participated in an online competition organized by [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org/) during which we won the "Rookie Award" (award for the best beginner team). The Saturday workshop was maintained remotely. The youngsters connected to a [jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) chat room, and we managed to conduct some programming activities.

### Season 2021-2022
The workshops at the community center and in our Douaires premises were very dynamic, but we were unable to participate in competitions due to a lack of participants!

### Season 2022-2023
This year, the workshop at the community center only occurred sporadically as it was regularly closed due to a lack of supervising staff. Our participation in the Robotics Trophies (now called the Junior French Robotics Cup) was canceled by the Normandy organization at the last minute. The digital workshop, however, remained as active as usual.
