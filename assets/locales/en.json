The activity at the Jardins de bas community center was not very successful because of many interruptions: COVID but mostly because of a lack of supervisors. We did not participate in any robotics competition this year because of a lack of participants.<p>For this 2022-2023 school year we are using the same ingredients:<ul><li>The Saturday digital workshop</li><li>The activity at the neighborhood house</li><li>The competitions if we manage to find motivated high school students</li><li>The continuation of the free membership for high school students who are interested in communication</li></ul>Moreover, we will be present at the forum of associations of Gaillon on September 10, 2022 from 10 am in the gardens of the parking of the Castle.</p><p>You can contact us via <a href='https://werobot.fr/contact-us'>our form</a> and to join, it is done directly <a href='https://www.helloasso.com/associations/we-robot/adhesions/we-robot-2022-23'>online here</a>.</p> "
